# PyBer ride data Summary by city type
In this summary by city type we observe that the higher the number of rides the average fare is lower.
For example the volume of rides in Rural and Suburban  areas exceeds the number of available drivers which translates in to higer average ride cost and higher average fares per driver. For Urban areas the opposite is true.

# Histogram Summary
The data in our histogram plot shows an upward trend in the total fares for the Urban and Suburban cities while Rural cities show some variation in total fares from February to April but the trend remains flat comapred to other city types
